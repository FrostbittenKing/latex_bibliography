  abstract = {RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) systems are emerging as one
	of the most pervasive computing technologies in history due to their
	low cost and their broad applicability. Although RFID networks have
	many advantages, they also present a number of inherent vulnerabilities
	with serious potential security implications. This paper develops
	a structural methodology for risks that RFID networks face by developing
	a classification of RFID attacks, presenting their important features,
	and discussing possible countermeasures. The goal of the paper is
	to categorize the existing weaknesses of RFID systems so that a better
	understanding of RFID attacks can be achieved and subsequently more
	efficient and effective algorithms, techniques and procedures to
	combat these attacks may be developed.},
